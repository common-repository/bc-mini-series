Create mini series for WordPress

== Description ==
Are you content creators that struggle with bloat plugins that offer too many options? 
I am one. I create this one to support myself and others to quickly create mini series on Wordpress

== Features == 
* Add any posts to series
* Have nested series (2 levels). If you need more than 2 levels, it's not a mini series anymore
* 1 post can be in one series at a time
* You can create unlimited series
* Ideal for tech bloggers (like myself)
